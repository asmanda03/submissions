Conceptual Exercise
What is a JWT?
A JWT (JSON Web Token) is a compact, URL-safe token used to represent claims between two parties. It's commonly used for authentication and information exchange. A JWT consists of three parts:

Header: Contains metadata such as the token type and signing algorithm.
Payload: Contains the claims, or the data being transmitted.
Signature: Ensures the token hasn't been altered.
Each part is Base64Url encoded and separated by dots.

What is the signature portion of the JWT? What does it do?
The signature portion of a JWT is created by taking the encoded header and payload, concatenating them with a period, and hashing them using a secret or private key and a specified algorithm (such as HMAC or RSA). This signature:

Verifies the integrity of the token.
Confirms that the sender is who it claims to be.
If the token's data changes, the signature will no longer match, making it easy to detect tampering.

If a JWT is intercepted, can the attacker see what's inside the payload?
Yes, if a JWT is intercepted, the attacker can see the contents of the payload because it is only Base64Url encoded and not encrypted. Sensitive information should not be stored in the payload unless additional encryption measures are used.

How can you implement authentication with a JWT? Describe how it works at a high level.
Login Request: The user sends a login request with credentials (e.g., username and password) to the authentication server.
Token Issuance: If the credentials are valid, the server generates a JWT containing user information and issues it to the client.
Client Storage: The client stores the JWT (typically in local storage or a cookie).
Request Authorization: For subsequent requests to protected resources, the client includes the JWT in the Authorization header (as a Bearer token).
Token Validation: The server validates the JWT by checking the signature and optionally verifying the token's claims (such as expiration time).
Access Control: If the token is valid, the server processes the request; otherwise, it denies access.
Compare and contrast unit, integration, and end-to-end tests.
Unit Tests:

Scope: Test individual components or functions in isolation.
Purpose: Ensure that each part of the application works as expected independently.
Characteristics: Fast, run frequently, low-level.
Integration Tests:

Scope: Test interactions between components or systems.
Purpose: Ensure that different parts of the application work together correctly.
Characteristics: More comprehensive than unit tests, but slower.
End-to-End Tests:

Scope: Test the entire application flow from start to finish.
Purpose: Validate that the entire system works as expected, including the user interface, backend, and integrations.
Characteristics: High-level, closest to real user scenarios, slowest to execute.
What is a mock? What are some things you would mock?
A mock is a simulated object that mimics the behavior of real objects in controlled ways. It's used in testing to isolate the unit of work from its dependencies.

Things you might mock include:

External Services (e.g., APIs, databases) to avoid actual network calls.
Complex Objects that are difficult to instantiate or require significant resources.
Behavior of methods in the system under test to test specific scenarios.
What is continuous integration?
Continuous Integration (CI) is a software development practice where developers frequently integrate code changes into a shared repository. Each integration triggers automated builds and tests to detect integration errors early. CI aims to improve software quality and reduce the time to deliver features.

What is an environment variable and what are they used for?
Environment Variables are key-value pairs used to configure applications outside of their source code. They can store sensitive information (e.g., API keys, passwords), configuration settings (e.g., database URLs), and feature toggles. They help manage differences across development, staging, and production environments without changing the code.

What is TDD? What are some benefits and drawbacks?
Test-Driven Development (TDD) is a software development methodology where tests are written before the code that needs to be tested. The process involves:

Writing a test for a new feature or function.
Running the test and seeing it fail.
Writing the code to make the test pass.
Refactoring the code while ensuring tests still pass.
Benefits:

Promotes better design and cleaner code.
Encourages high test coverage.
Reduces defects and improves maintainability.
Drawbacks:

Can be time-consuming, especially initially.
Requires a discipline and skill in writing good tests.
Might lead to over-engineering if not managed properly.
What is the value of using JSONSchema for validation?
JSONSchema provides a standard way to describe and validate the structure of JSON data. Its value includes:

Validation: Ensures that data conforms to a specified format.
Documentation: Provides a clear specification for the data structure.
Interoperability: Enables consistent data validation across different systems.
Error Handling: Offers clear validation errors, making it easier to debug issues.
What are some ways to decide which code to test?
To decide which code to test:

Critical Path: Prioritize testing code that is critical to the application's core functionality.
Complexity: Focus on complex areas that are more prone to errors.
Change Frequency: Test parts of the codebase that change frequently.
User Impact: Ensure testing covers features that have a significant impact on the user experience.
What does RETURNING do in SQL? When would you use it?
The RETURNING clause in SQL allows you to return values from rows affected by an INSERT, UPDATE, or DELETE statement. Itâ€™s useful for:

Fetching inserted or updated data without a separate SELECT query.
Retrieving auto-generated values (like IDs).
Obtaining affected rows for further processing or confirmation.
What are some differences between Web Sockets and HTTP?
Connection:

HTTP: Request-response model; connections are typically short-lived.
WebSockets: Persistent, bidirectional connection allowing for real-time communication.
Communication:

HTTP: Unidirectional; client sends a request and the server sends a response.
WebSockets: Full-duplex; both client and server can send messages independently.
Use Case:

HTTP: Suitable for traditional web applications and APIs.
WebSockets: Ideal for real-time applications like chat apps, live updates, and online gaming.
Did you prefer using Flask over Express? Why or why not?
This is subjective and varies based on personal experience and project requirements:

Flask (Python):

Pros: Simple and flexible; minimalistic with a lot of freedom; integrates well with Python libraries.
Cons: Might require more setup for larger applications; fewer built-in features compared to some frameworks.
Express (Node.js):

Pros: Extensive middleware ecosystem; faster to build APIs; closer to full-stack development if using JavaScript/TypeScript.
Cons: Less opinionated, which can lead to inconsistent project structures; potential callback or promise management complexities.
My preference depends on the project's context: for Python-based projects or when simplicity is key, Flask might be preferable. For full-stack JavaScript applications or projects requiring extensive middleware, Express could be more suitable.
